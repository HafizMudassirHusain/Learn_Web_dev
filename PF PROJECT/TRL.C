":'And you (the disbelievers) have (now) indeed come to Us alone just as We had created you at first, and you have left behind (your) backs whatever wealth and riches which We had bestowed upon you. And (today), We do not see your intercessors with you whom you used to assume to be (Our) partners amongst you; indeed, the tie between you (and your deities) is cut off, and lost from you is what you used to claim(94).\n",
":Indeed, it is Allah Who splits the grain and the seed; He brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living; this is Allah; (so then) where are you going back to?(95)\n",
":(He) brings forth the dawn after splitting the darkness, and He made the night (a means of) resting, and the sun and the moon as a count (i.e. a means of calculating time); this is the measurement set by the Almighty, the All-Knowing(96).\n",
":And it is He Who has created the stars for you, so that you may find direction through them in the darknesses of land and sea; We have explained Our signs in detail to the people of knowledge(97).\n",
":And it is He Who has created you from a single soul, you then have to stay in one place (i.e. this world) and stay entrusted in another place (i.e. the grave); indeed, We have explained Our verses in detail to the people of understanding(98).\n",
":And it is He Who has sent down water from the sky; so, with it We produced every growable thing. So, We produce from it vegetation from which We bring forth grains in layers, and from the blossoms of date trees; bunches (of fruit) close to one another, and gardens of grapes, and olives and pomegranates; similar in some way and different in another. Look at its fruit when it bears, and its ripening; therein are indeed signs for the people who believe(99).\n",
":And they have made Jinn as associates of Allah; whereas, it is only He Who created them, and they (the disbelievers) have fabricated for Him sons and daughters due to ignorance; Pure and Exalted is He from their utterances(100).\n",
":The Originator of the heavens and the earth; how can He have a child, whereas, He does not (even) have a wife? And He has created everything, and He knows everything(101).\n",
":This is Allah; your Lord, no one is worthy of worship except Him; the Creator of everything. So, worship Him, and He is the Guardian over all things(102).\n",
":Eyes do not encompass Him, and He encompasses all eyes; He is the Most Subtle, the Fully Aware(103).\n",
":Eye-opening arguments came to you from your Lord; so, whoever observed (them), it is therefore for his own good; and whoever became blind (from seeing them), it is hence for his own harm. And I am not a guardian over you(104).'\n",
":And this is how We explain Our verses in various ways and because that the disbelievers may say to you that 'You have studied (scriptures of the People of the Book) from someone,' and in order to make it clear to the people of knowledge(105).\n",
":Follow that which is revealed to you from your Lord; there is no one worthy of worship except Him. And turn away your face from the polytheists(106).\n",
":And had Allah willed; so, they would not have committed polytheism. And We have not made you a guardian over them, and you are not a disposer of their affairs(107).\n",
":Do not use offensive words against those (false deities) whom they worship other than Allah; that they (in retaliation) will insult Allah's Glory through injustice and ignorance. Likewise, in the eyes of every nation, We have made their deeds appear good, they are then to return towards their Lord, and He will inform them of what they used to do(109).\n",
":And they swore an oath by Allah with much emphasis in their oaths that if any sign came to them, they will therefore certainly believe in it. Say you (O Beloved); that 'The signs are actually with Allah, and what do you (people) know that when those (signs) come to them, they will therefore (still) not believe(110).\n",
